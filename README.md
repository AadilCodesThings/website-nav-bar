# website-nav-bar
playing around with css and html5 to build a simple nav bar on a website - doesnt do much but looks pretty

Made by Aadil Khan on April 29th 2017

In the interest of helping myself get better at CSS and HTML I decided to try and learn how to make visualy appealing navigation bars today.
With the help of some tutorials on the internet, I created this. It is very simple and minimalistic but I like it. 

I would like to fill it in with some content and functionality soon and perhaps use it to fill in some personal projects.
